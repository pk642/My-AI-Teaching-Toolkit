    <p>AI has revolutionized my teaching by streamlining content creation and enhancing student engagement. Tools like ChatGPT help me generate personalized quizzes, flashcards, and exit tickets in minutes. Visual and audio AI tools bring abstract concepts to life through podcasts and imagery, capturing students’ attention. Platforms like Elicit and ResearchRabbit simplify literature mapping and summarizing complex research. These innovations allow me to focus more on facilitating learning rather than preparing materials, making teaching more dynamic, efficient, and student-centered.
